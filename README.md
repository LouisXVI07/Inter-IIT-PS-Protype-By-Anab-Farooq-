Prototype 1: Real-Time KYC Screening System:

This project simulates a real-time KYC screening system that continuously checks new customer records against a cleaned sanctions list. It uses OCR (Tesseract) to extract names from documents, RapidFuzz for fuzzy matching, and maintains an incremental state table (kyc_state.csv) that stores all processed records to avoid reprocessingâ€”mimicking how Pathway updates and persists streaming state in real time. Incoming data is processed one record at a time, automatically updating results and generating explainable outputs that indicate whether each customer is flagged or clear. The system runs fully on Kaggle, demonstrating how continuous compliance screening can be prototyped without external infrastructure. The dataset along with its cleaned version is also provided and 2 ids (1 image and 1 pdf) are also included.

Prototype 2: Agentic AI for Risk Scoring and Decision-Making:

This prototype demonstrates an agentic AI system that autonomously performs risk scoring and decision-making for borrower transactions. It combines structured ML models and unstructured LLM reasoning in a closed-loop pipeline. Incoming borrower events are aggregated into a feature store, scaled, and passed through a lightweight risk classifier to generate a risk score. Relevant policy text is retrieved using semantic embeddings, and a local language model (Flan-T5) reasons over both numeric and textual context to decide actions such as ALLOW, VERIFY, FREEZE, or HUMAN_REVIEW. Each decision, along with reasoning and retrieved policy, is logged for transparency. The system operates fully offline without external APIs, embodying retrieval-augmented, autonomous, and explainable agentic behavior. A dummy dataset and policy doc will be generated by doc itself.
